# CryptoTrackerV2

Portfolio manager for crypto currencies built with Ruby on Rails.

The app allows users to create portfolios and add coins from a list of supported coins. It tracks current market prices using the [Coin Gecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) and display data about each of the user's portfolio.

This is an open source project, built out of necessity for myself for both learning Rails development as well as having a custom and simple solution to manage my crypto portfolio. Any input is welcome!
